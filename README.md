# Welcome to Bf(x)

This is a showcase app where you get to interact with, build and deploy various examples of ML in the context of what we do here at B. 

Start to explore some data and work through these examples to understand various signals that may exist in order for you to make sense of it all. ML can be very useful at this so take your time and enoy it ! 

There are three sections:

1. Learning --> Browse some examples already built for you !
2. Building --> Take a look at some data and try building a model yourself ! 
3. Deployment --> Now you have your model, see what it can do and how what you have defined as your "input" shapes the resulting output !
